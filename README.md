Title: 
Improvements in hydro-meterological systems for rainfall prediction

Description:
Rainfall prediction is crucial for various sectors such as agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. 
Accurate forecasting of rainfall can aid in optimizing agricultural practices, planning water usage, and mitigating the impacts of floods or droughts.
However, predicting rainfall is challenging due to the complex nature of atmospheric dynamics and the influence of various meteorological factors.
The problem to be addressed is the development of robust machine learning models capable of accurately predicting rainfall patterns over specific regions.

Problems it solves:
Project provides a user-friendly web interface for inputting weather data and selecting a city. It enables predictive modeling and analysis of weather conditions, empowering users to make informed decisions based on forecasts and insights tailored to their location.

The challenges we faced are:
Data Quality and Availability
Model Selection and Training
User Interface Design
Integration with Backend
Scalability and Performance
Validation and Testing
Deployment and Maintenance


The steps to test the project:
1.Locate Project Directory: Find the folder named "Weather" on your computer.
2.Install Dependencies: If you haven't already, make sure Flask is installed. You can install it using a package manager like pip.
3.Run the Flask Application: Open the "Weather" folder and locate the file named "app.py". Run this file using Python. This starts the Flask server.
4.Access the Web Application: Once the Flask server is running, open a web browser and type in "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" or "http://localhost:5000/" in the address bar. This will take you to the input form page.
5.Input Data and Submit Form: On the input form page, fill out the required weather data fields and select a city from the dropdown menu. Click the "Predict" button to submit the form.
6.View Prediction Results: After submitting the form, you'll be redirected to a new page displaying the prediction results for RainToday and RainTomorrow, along with the input data you provided.
7.Test Different Inputs: Feel free to test the application with different sets of input data and cities to observe how the predictions change.
8.Shutdown the Flask Application: Once you're done testing, go back to the terminal where the Flask server is running and stop it. You can usually do this by pressing "Ctrl + C".
