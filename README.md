Title: 
Improvements in hydro-meterological systems for rainfall prediction

Description:
Rainfall prediction is crucial for various sectors such as agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. 
Accurate forecasting of rainfall can aid in optimizing agricultural practices, planning water usage, and mitigating the impacts of floods or droughts.
However, predicting rainfall is challenging due to the complex nature of atmospheric dynamics and the influence of various meteorological factors.
The problem to be addressed is the development of robust machine learning models capable of accurately predicting rainfall patterns over specific regions.
